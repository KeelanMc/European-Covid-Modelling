# European-Covid-Modelling

Code was developed as part of a group entry into the European regional datathon 2021. Project was undertaken with Charloette Roman, Stefan Stein and  Patrick Zietkiewicz. Our report came 2nd of 40 teams. 
This was code I developed for my part of the group project. I used code originally developed by Joey O'Brien with permission. He developed the code originally for the paper 'A population-level SEIR model for COVID-19 scenarios (updated)'. Additional data was used from Our-world-in-data and google-mobility . 

The analysis can be replicated by running the scripts in the following order.
1. Our_model_fit.R
2. Scenario_Simulation.R
3. GAM_plot_new.R
4. Medians.R
5. R_Comp.R
6. Deathmodel.R
7. MobilityGranularity.R
8. Mobility.R
